These lecture notes are based on the course _6.S191 Introduction to Deep Learning_ during IAP 2021 semester at MIT.
Only the first five lectures are available as I dropped the course afterward. These lectures include:

1. Intro to Deep Learning
2. Deep Sequence Modeling
3. Deep Computer Vision
4. Deep Generative Modeling
5. Deep Reinforcement Modeling

Official recordings from this class are available at [the official course website][courseweb].

Please feel free to email me at `tcpc at mit dot edu` if you find any typos or factual errors.
