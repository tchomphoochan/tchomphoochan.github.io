Hi. My name is **Thanadol Chomphoochan**. I usually go by "**Pleng**." I am from Thailand, though I currently reside in Cambridge, MA. I am currently a graduate student at MIT in Computer Science and Engineering. I will be working with [Citadel][citadel]'s Global Quantitative Strategies (GQS) team in Chicago, starting July 2025.

You can contact me at [t.chomphoochan@gmail.com](mailto:t.chomphoochan@gmail.com). If your email explicitly requires a response, it will receive one within three business days.

## Interests

My current work is in bridging the gap between software and hardware transactional memory (TM) by developing a convenient framework for evaluating TM implementations on various platforms. I am generally interested in enabling building robust software, either through programming language design or formal verification. I have also dabbled in some electronics and embedded programming. I also spend a lot of my time teaching or brainstorming changes to introductory computer science curricula.

Outside of academics, I do (or try to do) these things, in no particular order: play jazz piano; [play Celeste](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLtfWLkX9rYs9AMjk_Qd88ZnkNoqTDX6A3&si=gnrryVMlVzCWulr4); [type fast](https://monkeytype.com/profile/tcpc); write [blog posts](/posts); consume Thai tea and matcha; pick locks.

## Name explanation

In Thailand, most people have two names they go by. One is the standard, legal first name, which is usually very long and based on Pali or Sanskrit. Another is their "nickname."

In many other cultures, nicknames emerge naturally from their first name (e.g., as an abbreviation or as a term of endearment), but in Thai culture, parents assign their children "nicknames" at birth. Since most Thais do not speak English, they usually adopt cool-sounding English words as their children's nicknames. You might also see nicknames that are just simple Thai words or concepts.

My name "Pleng" means song or music.

I did a UROP[^urop] with [Adam Chlipala][adamc] during IAP–Spring 2023. I made miscellaneous contributions to the [Bedrock2][bedrock2] project and attempted to implement and formally verify [crit-bit trees][critbit]. I started doing an [MEng][meng] thesis with him from Fall 2024 and will graduate in Spring 2025.

## Career and Credentials

I am working on an MEng degree and will graduate in May 2025. I will be working with [Citadel][citadel]'s Global Quantitative Strategies (GQS) team starting July 2025.

I [graduated][mit-degree] from MIT with Course 6-3 (Computer Science and Engineering) in May 2024. Although, I'm really closer to Course 6-2 (Electrical Engineering and Computer Science) in spirit.
I interned with [Frictionless Systems][frictionless] in my freshman year, [DRW][drw] in my sophomore year, [Instabase][instabase] in my junior year, and [Jump Trading][jump] in my senior year.

I briefly attended [Cranbrook Kingswood Upper School](https://schools.cranbrook.edu/) in 2019–2020 as part of Royal Thai Scholar program[^royal]. I did my primary and secondary education in my hometown, Lampang, Thailand.

[^royal]: Royal Thai Scholar Program: Essentially, what this means is my achievements led to Thailand government funding my study in the United States. The original intention was to complete a Ph.D here and return to Thailand.

## Book recommendations

Here, I list all the books I genuinely believe to be worth your time. I have personally, closely read all of these.

These books have had outsized impact on my programming career and experience:
- Abelson and Sussman, [_Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs_](https://mitp-content-server.mit.edu/books/content/sectbyfn/books_pres_0/6515/sicp.zip/index.html), 1984. (A "pure" perspective on what it means to program. I wrote a review [here]({% post_url 2021-06-24-sicp-is-cool %}).)
- Pierce et al., [_Software Foundations_](https://softwarefoundations.cis.upenn.edu/), 2017. (For people interested in formal verification. Read and do the exercises.)
- John Ousterhout, [_A Philosophy of Software Design_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/39996759-a-philosophy-of-software-design), 2018. (A good book on writing software in general.)

My teaching philosophy is best reflected by this book. I wish this was a mandatory reading for all serious educators:
- Greg Ashman, [_The Power of Explicit Teaching and Direct Instruction_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/55843444-the-power-of-explicit-teaching-and-direct-instruction), 2021.

To understand more about the nature of therapy (and self-actualization in general), I recommend reading these two OG[^og] books:
- Carl Rogers, [_On Becoming a Person: A Therapist's View of Psychotherapy_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/174879.On_Becoming_a_Person), 1961.
- David D. Burns, [_Feeling Good: The New Mood Therapy_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/46674.Feeling_Good), 1980.

[^og]: OG: [original](https://www.urbandictionary.com/define.php?term=OG), clasic, etc.

If you're into self-help at all, this book kept me sane:
- Oliver Burkeman, [_Four Thousand Weeks: Time Management for Mortals_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54785515-four-thousand-weeks), 2021.

I haven't read nearly enough fiction, but this one tickled my brain in all the right ways. It's also really short:
- qntm, [_There Is No Antimemetics Division_](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/54870256-there-is-no-antimemetics-division), 2020.

## Music recommendations

[Nier Monochrome by Feryquitous](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pwwe7j_EfsU) is the single, most beautiful piece of obscure music I've ever listened to.

If you want to listen to my curated playlist to understand my (very varied) musical taste better, knock yourself out: [Click here for Spotify playlist](https://open.spotify.com/playlist/2Chn0YVOgZNi1ZGljt0htZ?si=fc3a42e3dccb4c03).
